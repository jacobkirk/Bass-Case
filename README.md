Bass-Case
=========

A bass guitar instrument app

This is an app which intends to mimic a bass guitar as well as can be done on a mobile phone screen.

The operation of the app functions through detecting if or what fret the user is pressing, and then playing the 
appropriate sample when the user then presses the string; as you would using a real instrument

The app also features the ability to down-tune the strings and play harmonics, as well as featuring a distortion pedal.
